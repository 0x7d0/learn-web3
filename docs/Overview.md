Building the course content around Aavegotchi-inspired NFT characters can be an engaging and fun way to teach participants about crypto and Web3. Here's a step-by-step plan on how to structure the course content:

Introduction: Start with a brief introduction to the project, its goals, and the NFT characters. Introduce the concept of NFTs and their role in the course.

Creating a character: Teach participants how to create their own NFT character. Explain the different characteristics and attributes that can be customized, as well as how these attributes can be improved throughout the course.

Crypto basics: Cover the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and smart contracts. As participants progress through this section, they can unlock new attributes or abilities for their NFT characters.

Web3 basics: Introduce the concept of Web3, decentralized applications (dApps), and decentralized finance (DeFi). Participants can earn CRT tokens as they progress through this section and use them to upgrade their NFT characters or purchase new accessories.

Building dApps and interacting with NFTs: Teach participants how to build their own dApps and interact with NFTs on a blockchain platform. As they complete this section, participants can unlock new features for their characters, such as the ability to trade or battle with other characters.

Advanced topics: Cover more advanced topics in crypto and Web3, such as consensus algorithms, security, and scalability.

NFT Marketplace and economy: Teach participants how to create, buy, sell, and trade NFTs on various marketplaces. Discuss the role of tokenomics in NFT-based economies and how it can impact the value of their characters. As participants progress through this section, they can unlock special features or unique accessories for their characters.

NFT-based games and applications: Introduce participants to the world of NFT-based games, virtual worlds, and other applications where NFT characters can be used. Encourage them to experiment with their characters in these environments to gain a better understanding of the potential and versatility of NFTs.

Course completion and final project: As the course comes to an end, participants should have a fully developed NFT character with various attributes, skills, and accessories. The final project can involve creating a dApp, game, or another creative application that makes use of their NFT character. Assess and reward participants based on their progress, creativity, and the overall quality of their final projects.

A potential name for the entire project could be "CryptoNFT Academy" or "NFT Genesis: The Web3 Adventure." These names combine the concepts of cryptocurrency, NFTs, and learning in a way that highlights the unique and engaging aspects of the course.
